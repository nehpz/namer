# Lifeguard Custom Rules
# Replace these examples with rules specific to your project
# Each rule should have a clear name and detailed description

rules:
  - name: "Database transactions must be properly handled"
    description: "Ensure all database operations are wrapped in transactions with proper rollback handling. Check that commit/rollback is called in all code paths including error scenarios."

  - name: "API responses must include proper error context"
    description: "Verify that API error responses include sufficient context for debugging (request ID, timestamp, user context) without exposing sensitive information."

  - name: "Async operations should have timeout handling"
    description: "Check that long-running async operations (API calls, database queries, file operations) include appropriate timeout mechanisms to prevent hanging requests."
